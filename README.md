# GiulioCocconi's NeoVim Config

These are my [NeoVim](https://neovim.io) config files. 
`init.vim` is the entrypoint and it loads the others `.vim` files in the `core` directory.

### Features

- [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) as plugin manager
- [fzf.vim](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim) as file finder
- [vim-startify](https://github.com/mhinz/vim-startify) as greeter
- [rigel](https://github.com/Rigellute/rigel) and [airline](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline) for theming
- Useful bindings
- ...

### How to install it (LINUX ONLY)
You can install the configuration running
```
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/GiulioCocconi/nvim-config ~/.config/nvim
```
But I instead recommend copying the lines of your interest in YOUR config
